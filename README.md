This repository is a collection of all files associated with the control of our guitar bot.

Assembly is used to issue instructions to a NIOSII processor that has been loaded on an Altera De1-SoC FPGA. 

There are three main hardware mechanisms to be controlled: strumming of the guitar strings, pressing down the chords of the
guitar, and the car that moves up and down the neck of the guitar for chord placement (The chord pressing mechanism is
mounted on this car).
